		<p>Below is a list of the various aspects of coaching softball.  These resources can be used
		as part of a practice plan, an idea for developing a specific skill, or to broaden your understanding
		of this competative sport.  By making this resource available online, it can be accessed anywhere your
		phone, tablet or computer gets the internet.  By clicking on the skillset, it will direct you to a page where
		there are diagrams, breakdowns and coaching points to improve or develop your athlete. Please use these resources 
		responsibly, as I do not take responsibility for their misuse or misimplentation, and it is the responsiblity
		of the coach to determine if the drill is appropriate for your athlete(s).</p>
