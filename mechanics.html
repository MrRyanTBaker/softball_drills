		<h3>Athletic Stance</h3>
		
		<h3>Throwing</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Grip</li>
				<p>The player should hold the ball based on the size of their hand.  Players that are working on throwing at an earlier age
				may use a smaller ball to work on the other aspects of the throw.  While holding the ball, players will place their pointer, middle
				and ring fingers across the seams, with the thumb opposite the middle finger.  The palm should not be in contact with the ball, and there
				should be equal distance between each finger.</p></br>

			<li>Stance</li>	
				<p>Coaches may call this different things, but the idea is the same from term-to-term.  It may be called the "Star Position" or the "Power K" 
				because of the shape the body makes when it's executed properly.  THe ball is brought back behind the head, the tricept or elbow is parallel to the 
				ground, and the upper and lower parts of the arm at a 90 degree angle.  The body's position will be sideways, with their glove hand pointing towards
				their target.  The player's feet should be spaced outside the shoulders to allow for rotation in the throw.  It is from this position that the stance 
				gets its name.  The player's arms and legs make the points of the "star" or "K".</p></br>
				
				<p>From this position, the player is ready to initiate the throwing motion.  They will drive off the back leg, which would be the same foot as the 
				hand they throw with and stepping forward or pushing through their lead foot, which is opposite their throwing hand.  Rotation begins with the hips 
				and back leg while the elbow comes forward for the release.</p></br>

			<li>Release</li>
				<p>As the elbow comes forward, the player should keep an open chest and not allow it to tuck into the body.  The wrist should be back as the arm moves 
				toward the front of the body.  After the arm has passed back infront of the head, the arm should remain parallel to the ground.  The throwing arm comes 
				through, rolling the ball off of the fingertips, creating a backspin on the ball.  This rolling motion is accompanied by the wrist flick, creating a 
				"snap".  To keep the arm from stopping, instruct the player to follow-through as if they were reaching in their opposite pocket.</p></br>
